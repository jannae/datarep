{"name":"Data Representation","tagline":"Final Project Proposal","body":"#Final Project Proposal\r\n\r\nI read [this article](http://www.tufts.edu/alumni/magazine/fall2013/features/up-in-arms.html) recently from Tufts University Alumni Magazine that I found pretty fascinating. It addresses the historical ties of our societal core values, and posits a thesis that America may not necessarily honestly exist as \"one nation\" after all. Because the essay itself tends to lean towards the topics of crime rates and gun control and how attitudes towards these issues differ so greatly across the regions of our country, I began to think about the general value of human life as a topic of discussion.\r\n\r\n1. **What is your data set?**\r\n\t\r\n\tI am planning to dig into the bowels of the [CDC's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System](http://www.cdc.gov/brfss/), ideally down to the county level in order to really glean information on the regional differences. I have no current expectation of how successful this venture may be. This data is vast, and so far, rather cumbersome to manipulate.\r\n\r\n2. **What is the medium?**\r\n\r\n\tWill likely be an interactive web-based map viz using D3.js. If I can think of a physical form that this can take, I may shift gears, but right now, I'm going web.\r\n\r\n3. **What is the central question?**\r\n\r\n\tHow do the core values for controllable mortality differ across regions of the United States? Do these differences show any relationship to attitudes towards gun control, capital punishment and crime rates?","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
